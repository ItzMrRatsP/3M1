- We made this project for the RDC 2025 (Roblox Developer Challenge 2025) and we never thought we gonna actually win the first place, but oh well.. Life had other plans for us!
- This became a ritual, We open-source our gamejam scripts after its finished :D
- No mobile or console complability, Add them yourself.
- Have fun with this, Re-selling this is prohibated and we'll take legal action against it.
